Format chosen using the first line: $MeshFormat
Loading mesh in Gmsh format 2.0 from file /home/eelis/git/mylly-python/trafocrunch/data/1383/1383.msh
Allocating for 406 knots and 886 elements.
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 128 (out of 886) lower dimensional elements.
Node 24 belongs to maximum of 10 elements
Found 76 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 128 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to indx 758.
Moved 758 elements (out of 886) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
